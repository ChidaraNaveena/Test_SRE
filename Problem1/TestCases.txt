Basic Functionality

Description: Verify that the utility correctly creates missing folders.
Setup:
Source Directory: source_dir contains:
folder1
folder1/subfolder
Target Directory: target_dir is empty.
Expected Result:
target_dir should have:
folder1
folder1/subfolder
Empty Source Directory

Description: Test the function with an empty source directory.
Setup:
Source Directory: source_dir is empty.
Target Directory: target_dir contains:
existing_folder
Expected Result:
target_dir should still have:
existing_folder
Non-Existing Source Directory

Description: Test the function when the source directory does not exist.
Setup:
Source Directory: non_existent_source (non-existent path).
Target Directory: target_dir contains:
existing_folder
